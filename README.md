## Configuration

You're going to need to specify a Moralis Cloud Public ID to connect to Moralis.

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=""
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can run the project locally with:

```
npm run dev
```
